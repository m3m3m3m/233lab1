This lab is designed to learn methods of characterizing circuiting systems by analyzing RC circuit system, and familiarize with the test bench instruments. In this lab, we are going to explore interesting characteristics of the RC circuit. \\
\phantom{ } RC circuit is a basic circuit as shown in figure[\ref{fig:cir}], which could be found in many complex circuit. Thus, it is of much importance to figure out how it works and how to solve the circuit. We test this circuit with square and sinusoidal input, measuring time constants and plotting oscillograph, observing and analyzing output signals, to verify the result we figured out in prelab.
